```

Return to the root folder of the project and start the server. You can launch the `start.bat` file with a **double click** or in the terminal with `.\start.bat`.

```shell
.\start.bat
```

#### Installation tutorial for linux :
![Linux install](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/InstaZDLL/Besson_Ethan_info1a_164_2023/965beba426ba79254121e839f498331c54fec2b9/.github/Linux_install_tutorial.gif)


## Environment Variables


To run this project, you will need to modify the following environment variables to your `.env` file

`USER_MYSQL` 

`PASS_MYSQL`

`NAME_BD_MYSQL`

`NAME_FILE_DUMP_SQL_BD`

`SELECT_QUERY_ENABLED` - Optional, options : true or false ‚ÑπÔ∏è

## Usage/Examples


You can change the SQL request to show an other table.

```python
@bp.route('/materiel')
def materiel():
    """
    Retrieves the data from the table t_materiel in the MySQL database and displays it on the page "materiel.html".
    """
    query = "SELECT * FROM t_materiel" # Modify with your query here
    cursor.execute(query)
    data = cursor.fetchall()

    return render_template('materiel.html', data=data)
```

If you change something here don't forget to modify the html code too in the `materiel.html`, or you can also opt for automatic headers such as `marques.html`.

Note : if you change a request in some case you need to change the js and the form to request so that the information is properly handeled.
