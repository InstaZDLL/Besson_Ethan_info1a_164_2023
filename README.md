## Run Locally

### Windows

Clone the project.

```git
git clone https://github.com/InstaZDLL/Besson_Ethan_info1a_164_2023.git
```

Go to the project directory.

```shell
cd Besson_Ethan_info1a_164_2023
```

Modify the [environment variables](https://github.com/InstaZDLL/Besson_Ethan_info1a_164_2023#environment-variables) in the `.env` file. You can edit the file with Notepad or another text editing tool.

```shell
cd FlaskWebS/database
```
```shell
notepad besson_ethan_info_1a.sql
```

Return to the root folder of the project and start the server. You can launch the `start.bat` file with a **double click** or in the terminal with `.\start.bat`.

```shell
.\start.bat
```

### Linux

Clone the project.

```git
git clone https://github.com/InstaZDLL/Besson_Ethan_info1a_164_2023.git
```

Go to the project directory.

```shell
cd Besson_Ethan_info1a_164_2023
```

Modify the [environment variables](https://github.com/InstaZDLL/Besson_Ethan_info1a_164_2023#environment-variables) in the `.env` file. You can use the following command to edit the file:

```shell
nano .env
```

Change, if needed, the `besson_ethan_info_1a.sql` file in the `database` directory. You can use the following command to edit the file:

```shell
cd FlaskWebS/database
```
```shell
nano besson_ethan_info_1a.sql
```

Return to the root folder of the project and start the server using the following command:

`PASS_MYSQL`

`NAME_BD_MYSQL`

`NAME_FILE_DUMP_SQL_BD`

## Usage/Examples


You can change the sql request to show an other table.

```python
@bp.route('/marques')
def marques():
    """
    Retrieves the data from the t_brand table in the MySQL database and displays it on the "brands.html" page.
    """
    query = """
        SELECT t_marque.id_marque, t_marque.nom_marque, description_marque
        FROM t_marque
        WHERE t_marque.id_marque;
    """
    cursor.execute(query)
    data = cursor.fetchall()

    headers = [column[0] for column in cursor.description]

    return render_template('marques.html', data=data, headers=headers)
```

If you change something here don't forget to modify the html code too in the `personnes.html`, or you can also opt for automatic headers such as `marques.html`.
