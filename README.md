## Run Locally


Clone the project.

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/InstaZDLL/Besson_Ethan_info1a_164_2023.git
```

Go to the project directory.

```bash
  cd Besson_Ethan_info1a_164_2023
```

Install dependencies.

*If you use PyCharm, you donâ€™t need to run this command, PyCharm installs all dependencies automatically*

```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**[Linux only]** Modify the [environment variables](https://github.com/InstaZDLL/FlaskWebS#environment-variables) in the.env file.

*Note : if you are on windows, just edit the file with notepad or other text editing tool*

```bash
  nano .env
```

Go to the database folder.

```bash
  cd database
```

**[Linux only]** Change if you need, the `besson_ethan_info_1a.sql` and paste your dump in this file.

*Note : if you are on windows, just edit the file with notepad or other text editing tool*
```bash
  nano besson_ethan_info_1a.sql
```

Run the `mysql_dump_import.py` to import the database.

```bash
  py mysql_dump_import.py
```

Return to the root folder of the project and start the server.

```bash
  cd ..
  py main.py
```


## Environment Variables


To run this project, you will need to modify the following environment variables to your `.env` file

`USER_MYSQL` 

`PASS_MYSQL`

`NAME_BD_MYSQL`

`NAME_FILE_DUMP_SQL_BD`


## Usage/Examples


You can change the sql request to show an other table.

```python
@app.route('/marques')
def marques():
    """
    Retrieves the data from the t_brand table in the MySQL database and displays it on the "brands.html" page.
    """
    query = """
        SELECT t_marque.id_marque, t_marque.nom_marque, description_marque
        FROM t_marque
        WHERE t_marque.id_marque;
    """
    cursor.execute(query)
    data = cursor.fetchall()

    headers = [column[0] for column in cursor.description]

    return render_template('marques.html', data=data, headers=headers)
```

If you change something here don't forget to modify the html code too in the `personnes.html`, or you can also opt for automatic headers such as `marques.html`.
